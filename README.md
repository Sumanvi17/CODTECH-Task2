Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Python Program to track and manage student grades. The
program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
GPA).


Key Activities

1. Designed and implemented a Student class to store student grades.
2. Created a StudentManager class to manage multiple students.
3. Developed a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system.
4. Implemented methods to add students, retrieve students, and display all students.
5. Calculated averages, letter grades, and GPAs for each student.


Technologies Used

- Python 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts


Features

1. Student management: add, retrieve, and display students.
2. Grade management: add grades for each student.
3. Average calculation: calculate average grades for each student.
4. Letter grade and GPA calculation: calculate letter grades and GPAs based on average grades.
5. Menu-driven interface: easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system


  Key Insights

1. Encapsulation: the Student class encapsulates student grades and methods to calculate averages, letter grades, and GPAs.
2. Abstraction: the StudentManager class abstracts the complexity of managing multiple students.
3. Modularity: the system is modular, with separate classes and methods for each functionality.
4. Reusability: the Student and StudentManager classes can be reused in other applications.
5. Scalability: the system can be easily scaled to manage a large number of students.
